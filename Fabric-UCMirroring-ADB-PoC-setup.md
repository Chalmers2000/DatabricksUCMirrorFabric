# Fabric Mirroring for Azure Databricks Unity Catalog — Private-Network PoC

> **Audience:** Customer architects and platform engineers evaluating a proof-of-concept.
> **Assumes:** Working knowledge of Azure, Fabric, networking, and Databricks. Implementation steps and validation checkpoints only.

---

## 1. Scenario

Mirror Azure Databricks Unity Catalog tables into Fabric with **no data movement** — only the catalog structure is mirrored, and the underlying data is accessed through shortcuts — where the Databricks workspace is **private** and Fabric reaches it over a **virtual network (VNet) data gateway**.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1 Microsoft Fabric
- Fabric capacity on an **F SKU** (required for trusted workspace access).
- A **workspace identity** created on the Fabric workspace.
- Region on the [mirroring support list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/azure-databricks-limitations).
- Fabric Runtime **≥ Spark 3.4 / Delta 2.4**.

### 2.2 Azure Databricks & Unity Catalog
- Databricks workspace with **Unity Catalog enabled**.
- **External data access enabled** on the metastore.
- Configuring identity is a Databricks **workspace user/admin** holding **`EXTERNAL USE SCHEMA`** on the target schema.

### 2.3 Networking
- Databricks deployed via **VNet injection** with **front-end (inbound) Private Link** configured.
- **ADLS Gen2** account backing the Delta tables must be reachable by Fabric.

---

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1 — Enable external access in Unity Catalog
**Actions**
- Enable external data access on the metastore.
- Grant **`EXTERNAL USE SCHEMA`** on the target schema.
  - Credential vending issues **short-lived credentials**, refreshed hourly and revocable in Unity Catalog.

**Docs:** [Access Databricks data using external systems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-access/) · [Mirroring tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/azure-databricks-tutorial)

### Step 2 — Configure Databricks front-end Private Link
**Actions**
- Deploy via VNet injection and create the workspace private endpoint (**`databricks_ui_api`**).
  - Add **`browser_authentication`** for organizational-account SSO.
- Enforce private connectivity so the workspace **rejects all public network connections**.

**Docs:** [Azure Private Link concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/concepts/private-link) · [ADB behind a private endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/azure-databricks-private-endpoint)

### Step 3 — Create the Fabric VNet data gateway
**Actions**
- Create the VNet data gateway in the **same region** as the Databricks workspace.
- Ensure the gateway can **reach the workspace private endpoint** (e.g., deploy it in the same VNet).

**Docs:** [ADB behind a private endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/azure-databricks-private-endpoint)

### Step 4 — Create the Azure Databricks connection (pre-create it)
**Actions**
- Go to **Settings → Manage connections and gateways → New → Virtual network connection**.
  - Select the gateway, connection type **Azure Databricks workspace**, the workspace URL, and **organizational-account** or **service-principal** auth.
- Create it **before** the mirror item — a known issue blocks selecting the gateway during item creation.

**Docs:** [ADB behind a private endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/azure-databricks-private-endpoint)

### Step 5 — *(If storage is firewalled)* Enable Trusted Workspace Access to ADLS Gen2
**Actions**
- Grant the identity **Storage Blob Data Reader** (folder-level **Read/Execute** recommended).
- Add a **resource instance rule** for the Fabric workspace on the storage account.
  - **ARM template or PowerShell only** — the Azure portal is not supported.
  - Fabric uses the **Workspace Identity** to traverse the storage firewall, regardless of the connection's auth method.

**Docs:** [Trusted workspace access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/security-trusted-workspace-access) · [Secure Fabric mirrored databases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/azure-databricks-security)

### Step 6 — Create the Mirrored Azure Databricks catalog item
**Actions**
- **New item → Mirrored Azure Databricks catalog**; select the existing connection.
- Choose the catalog, schemas, and tables (inclusion/exclusion list).
  - For firewalled storage, use the **Network Security** tab with a **folder-scoped endpoint**.
- **Review and Create.**

**Docs:** [Mirroring tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/azure-databricks-tutorial)

---

## 4. Validation

- [ ] Mirrored item is created with **one Databricks-type shortcut per table**.
- [ ] Query the mirrored tables via the **SQL analytics endpoint** (T-SQL) to confirm data is readable.
- [ ] Shortcuts appear **only** for tables whose storage account matches the ADLS connection.
- [ ] Firewall-enabled storage connections show status **Offline** in Manage connections — **expected, not an error**.
- [ ] Add a schema/table in Unity Catalog and confirm **metadata sync** to Fabric.

## 5. Networking Notes

| Concern | Determination |
|---|---|
| **Public access disabled?** | **Yes** — on both the Databricks workspace (gateway reaches it privately) and ADLS Gen2 (trusted workspace access supports public access disabled). *Databricks workspace root storage behind a storage firewall is **not** supported.* |
| **Azure Databricks Workspace Private Link** | **Required.** Front-end/inbound Private Link is a prerequisite; the VNet data gateway terminates against that workspace private endpoint. |
| **Microsoft Fabric workspace Private Link** | **Not required.** An inbound control over access *to the Fabric workspace*, independent of the outbound mirroring path. Enable only to lock down inbound access to the Fabric workspace itself. |
| **Trusted Workspace Access** | **Storage path only.** Requires a connection directly to the storage account, independent of the Databricks connection. |
| **Fabric VNet data gateway** | **Databricks path only.** Same region as the workspace; on-premises data gateway is **not** supported. |

## 6. Important Limitations

- **Unsupported table types:** RLS/CLM tables, Lakehouse federated tables, Delta sharing tables, streaming tables, views, and materialized views. **Delta format only.**
- **Governance is not inherited:** Unity Catalog permissions are not mirrored; the **connection creator's credential is used for all queries**, so UC access controls do not apply to Fabric users — re-implement access in Fabric.
- **Connection ordering:** The VNet-gateway connection cannot be created during mirror-item creation; **pre-create it**.
- **Other:** Renaming a schema/table in the inclusion/exclusion list is not supported; trusted workspace access is not available in **Trial** capacities.
